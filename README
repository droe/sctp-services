These dummy SCTP services are designed to be run using daemon(1), for example
through /etc/rc.local, as was done on scanme.roe.ch:

/usr/sbin/daemon -c -f -p /var/run/sctp-httpd.pid /usr/local/sbin/sctp-httpd
/usr/sbin/daemon -c -f -p /var/run/sctp-smtpd.pid /usr/local/sbin/sctp-smtpd
/usr/sbin/daemon -c -f -p /var/run/sctp-echod.pid /usr/local/sbin/sctp-echod
/usr/sbin/daemon -c -f -p /var/run/sctp-discardd.pid /usr/local/sbin/sctp-discardd

Both /etc/rc.local and daemon(1) are BSD specific.  If anyone on e.g. Linux
is interested, adding some portable code to detach from tty and write a pid
file is simple and I'll happily do that if it would be useful to someone.

This code was originally published only in a private repository for Nmap
developers, but given that this code could be useful beyond Nmap I decided to
make it public under dual BSD-license and original Nmap licensing terms.
